<div class="grid_5 clearfix news_brief">“To re-define the benchmark of service, cost and quality into the steel industry by utilising the latest and most efficient technologies coupled with highly committed and experienced employees.”</div>
<div class="grid_11 clearfix news_content">Although newly established Steel Dynamics is aiming it sights clearly in the direction of becoming a large player in the steel industry. With some 40,000 square foot of warehousing, state of the art laser and HD plasma cutting coupled with a broad spectrum of stock and a unique business operating system they are well positioned to bring that mission to life. Speaking to one of the directors, Danny McKinley, he had the following to say:<br><br>

<em>“Its long been an ambition of mine to run a very focused and dynamically different company in the steel industry. Over the past 18 years I have found most companies try and achieve this but the reality is very different. From inception I wanted Steel Dynamics to have a very clear and concise mission statement, something that customers, employees and suppliers could all see what we are about and what we want to achieve and, more importantly what we expect. It’s this Mission statement that will help and guide us along our roadmap to achieving sustainable, quality growth.“</em>
